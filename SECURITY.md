# Security Policy

## üîí Supported Versions

Source License is currently in **Alpha** status. We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest Alpha | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Previous Alpha Builds | ‚ùå No |

**Note**: As we're in alpha, we recommend always using the latest version from the main branch.

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Source License, please report it responsibly.

### üìß Private Reporting (Preferred)

For sensitive security issues, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/PixelRidge-Softworks/Source-License/security) of our repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability details
4. Submit your report

This method ensures that sensitive security information is kept private until a fix can be developed and deployed.

### üêõ Public Reporting

For less sensitive security issues that don't pose immediate risk if disclosed publicly, you can:

1. Use our [Security Vulnerability Issue Template](https://github.com/PixelRidge-Softworks/Source-License/issues/new?assignees=&labels=security%2Ccritical&template=security_vulnerability.yml&title=%5BSECURITY%5D%3A+)
2. Create a public issue with the `security` label

### üìß Direct Contact

If you prefer not to use GitHub's reporting system:

- **Email**: Create a private issue first, and we can coordinate alternative communication if needed
- **Subject Line**: Use `[SECURITY] Source License Vulnerability Report`

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Response Process

### Initial Response
1. **Acknowledgment**: We aim to acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within **24 hours**
2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within **72 hours**
3. **Status Updates**: Regular updates will be provided as we work on the issue

### Investigation Process
1. **Verification**: We will reproduce and verify the reported vulnerability
2. **Impact Assessment**: Determine the scope and severity of the security issue
3. **Fix Development**: Develop and test a security patch
4. **Security Advisory**: Prepare security advisory if needed

### Resolution Timeline
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Patches within 7 days

- **Medium Severity**: Patches within 30 days
- **Low Severity**: Included in next regular release

## üèÜ Security Researcher Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help improve Source License's security:

### Hall of Fame
We maintain a security researchers hall of fame for those who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- Your name will be added to our security credits (with your permission)
- Recognition in release notes for security fixes
- Public acknowledgment in our documentation

### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

**‚úÖ We encourage:**
- Responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities
- Providing detailed information to help us reproduce issues
- Allowing reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### Production Deployment
- **Always use HTTPS** in production (`FORCE_SSL=true`)
- **Strong passwords** for admin accounts and database access
- **Regular updates** to the latest version
- **Firewall configuration** to restrict database access
- **Environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Regular backups** with encryption at rest

### Database Security
- Use dedicated database users with minimal required permissions
- Enable database connection encryption (SSL/TLS)
- Regularly update database software
- Monitor database access logs
- Use strong, unique passwords for database accounts

### API Security  
- **Rotate JWT secrets** regularly in production
- **Rate limiting** on API endpoints
- **API key management** for integrations
- **CORS configuration** for web applications
- **Input validation** on all API endpoints

### License Management Security
- Protect license generation endpoints with proper authentication
- Monitor license validation attempts for abuse
- Implement rate limiting on license operations
- Secure storage of license keys and customer data
- Regular auditing of license operations

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Features in Source License

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** for API access
- **Session management** with configurable timeouts
- **Role-based access control** for admin functions
- **Secure password hashing** using industry standards
- **Multi-factor authentication support** (planned)

### Data Protection
- **SQL injection prevention** using prepared statements (Sequel ORM)
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection** in templates
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection**
- **Secure headers** configuration
- **Input validation and sanitization**

### Infrastructure Security
- **Security middleware** for common protections
